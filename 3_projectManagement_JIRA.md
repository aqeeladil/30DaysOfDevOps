### Waterfall
- Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach where each phase (requirements, design, development, testing, deployment) must be completed before the next begins.
- Waterfall is ideal for projects with a clear, fixed scope and well-defined requirements.


### Agile
- Agile is an iterative, incremental approach where work is divided into small cycles called sprints, allowing for continuous improvement and feedback.
- Agile is better for projects where requirements might change, the timeline is flexible, and frequent customer feedback is valuable.


### JIRA
- Jira is a powerful project management and issue-tracking tool widely used in software development and Agile project management. 
- Agile teams use Jira to plan, track, and release software with support for issue tracking and sprint management.
- Teams outside of software development use Jira to manage tasks, workflows, and project timelines.
- Integrations with CI/CD tools help track the deployment pipeline, supporting DevOps workflows.
